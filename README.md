# Benes-Network-Online

1.Adaptive-NEW.py
  Measure the averate number of routed paths per multiple random input permutations.
  Each new permutation starts with an empty Benes network, input to output demands are
  established in a random order and the program count the number of established paths
  from the given random permutation.
  This is done for the new PathFinder algorithm

1.Adaptive-TL.py
  Same as above but for the algorithms: 1) TTA, 2) LLA, and 3) Random
